class NornFlow:
    """
    NornFlow extends Nornir with a structured workflow system, task discovery, and configuration
    management capabilities. It serves as the main entry point for executing network automation
    jobs that follow a defined workflow pattern.

    Key features:
    - Automated assets discovery from local directories
    - Workflow management and execution
    - Consistent configuration handling
    - Advanced inventory filtering with custom filter functions
    - Customizable execution processors
    - Variables system with multi-level precedence

    The NornFlow object lifecycle typically involves:
    1. Initialization with settings (from file or explicit object)
    2. Automatic discovery of available tasks
    3. Automatic discovery of available workflows (not mandatory)
    4. Automatic discovery of available filters (not mandatory)
    5. Selection of a workflow (by object, name, file path, or dictionary definition)
    6. Execution of the workflow against the filtered Nornir inventory

    Tasks are executed in order as defined in the workflow, providing a structured
    approach to network automation operations.

    Processor precedence follows this order (highest to lowest priority):
    1. Processors provided directly to the NornFlow constructor
    2. Processors specified in the workflow definition
    3. Processors specified in the NornFlow settings
    4. Default processor if none of the above are specified

    Variable precedence follows this order (highest to lowest priority):
    1. CLI variables (passed via command line or set programmatically as overrides)
    2. Workflow variables (defined in workflow file)
    3. Environment variables
    4. Variables from external files

    CLI Variables - Dual Nature:
    CLI variables in NornFlow serve a dual purpose:
    1. Traditional CLI usage: Variables parsed from command-line arguments (--vars)
    2. Override mechanism: Programmatically set variables with highest precedence

    This dual nature allows CLI variables to be:
    - Set during NornFlow initialization for workflow creation
    - Updated at runtime during workflow execution for maximum flexibility
    - Used as a universal override mechanism in programmatic scenarios

    The term "CLI variables" reflects their highest precedence nature and primary
    source (command-line interface), while also serving as a flexible override
    mechanism for any high-priority variable needs.

class NornFlowBuilder:
    """
    Builder class for constructing NornFlow objects with a fluent interface.

    The builder provides a structured way to configure all aspects of a NornFlow instance:
    - Settings configuration (via object or file path)
    - Workflow configuration (via object, name, path or dictionary)
    - Processor registration
    - CLI variables (with highest precedence in variable resolution)
    - Additional keyword arguments

    CLI Variables in Builder Context:
    The builder's `with_cli_vars()` method sets variables that will have the highest
    precedence in the variable resolution system. While termed "CLI variables" due to
    their primary use case (command-line arguments), these serve as a universal
    override mechanism in the builder pattern:

    - Can represent actual CLI arguments parsed by a command-line interface
    - Can be set programmatically for workflow customization
    - Always override any other variable source (workflow vars, defaults, etc.)
    - Are passed to the workflow during execution with late-binding support

    Usage Examples:
        # Basic usage
        builder = NornFlowBuilder()
        nornflow = builder.with_settings_path('settings.yaml')
                          .with_workflow_name('deploy')
                          .with_cli_vars({'env': 'prod', 'debug': True})
                          .build()

        # Programmatic override usage
        builder = NornFlowBuilder()
        if emergency_mode:
            cli_overrides = {'skip_tests': True, 'timeout': 300}
        else:
            cli_overrides = {'run_full_suite': True}

        nornflow = builder.with_workflow_object(workflow)
                          .with_cli_vars(cli_overrides)
                          .build()

    Order of preference for building a NornFlowSettings object:
      1. with_settings_object()
      2. with_settings_path()

    Order of preference for building a Workflow object:
      1. with_workflow_object()
      2. with_workflow_name()
      3. with_workflow_path()
      4. with_workflow_dict()

    NOTE: In this NornFlowBuilder class, we actually enforce only the order of items 1 and 2.
    It's only if neither are provided that NornFlowBuilder avails of the WorkflowFactory class
    which will enforce the preference order of items 3 and 4.
